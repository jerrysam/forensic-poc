Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Practices&#160; 

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation 

&#160; 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated upon consolidation. Certain amounts, which are not material, in the prior years&#8217; consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 

The Company consummated the GNOG Transaction on the GNOG Closing Date. In the GNOG Transaction, the Company was determined to be the accounting acquirer and, as such, the acquisition is considered a business combination under Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 805, Business Combinations , and was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. These consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of the Company, except that, due to the timing of the consummation of the GNOG Transaction, these consolidated financial statements exclude the operations of GNOG prior to the GNOG Closing Date.

&#160; 

Segments 

The Company regularly reviews its operating segments and the approach used by the chief operating decision maker (&#8220;CODM&#8221;) to evaluate performance and allocate resources. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company had two distinct operating segments: a business-to-consumer (&#8220;B2C&#8221;) segment, which included its Sportsbook, iGaming and DFS product offerings, as well as media and other consumer product offerings, and a business-to-business (&#8220;B2B&#8221;) segment, which had principal activities involving the design and development of gaming software. 

However, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022, as a result of the Company&#8217;s integration of the technology and expertise of SBTech, the Company began to view the B2B segment primarily as a cost center of the B2C segment and, therefore, began to operate its business and report its results as a single operating segment. The Company&#8217;s determination that it operates as a single segment is consistent with the CODM's regular review of consolidated financial information for the purposes of evaluating performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting for future periods. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the new segment presentation. 

Foreign Currency and Comprehensive Loss 

&#160; 

Prior to January 1, 2022, the Company's reporting currency was the U.S. dollar while the functional currency of the Company&#8217;s significant non-U.S. subsidiaries was the Euro. The financial statements of the Company&#8217;s significant non-U.S. subsidiaries were translated into United States dollars in accordance with ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters , using period-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for the period for revenues, costs and expenses and historical rates for equity. For the period ending December 31, 2021, the translation gain is included in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. Effective as of January 1, 2022, the Company&#8217;s reporting currency remained the U.S. dollar and the functional currency of the Company's significant non-U.S. subsidiaries&#8217; functional currency was changed from the Euro to the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the Company did not have to translate the financial statements of its significant non-U.S. subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. 

During 2023, 2022 and 2021, foreign currency transactions did not have a material impact on net loss. 

&#160; 

Use of Estimates 

&#160; 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates and assumptions reflected in the financial statements relate to and include, but are not limited to, the valuation and expensing of equity awards, accounting for contingencies and uncertainties, purchase price allocations, including fair value estimates of intangible assets, the estimated useful lives of fixed assets and intangible assets, internally developed software costs and accrued expenses. 

&#160; 

Going Concern 

&#160; 

The Company currently expects that its cash will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least twelve months after February 16, 2024. The Company has experienced operating losses and negative operating cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. While certain jurisdictions will experience improved operating cash flow, the Company expects to continue to incur annual operating losses for the next twelve months. 

&#160; 

Concentration Risks and Uncertainties 

&#160; 

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and cash reserved for users. The Company maintains separate accounts for cash and cash reserved for users primarily across several financial institutions. Some of the amounts held exceed federally insured limits. Management believes all financial institutions holding its cash are of high credit quality and does not believe the Company is subject to unusual credit risk beyond the normal credit risk associated with commercial banking relationships. 

&#160; 

The Company relies on a limited number of vendors to support operations. In particular, a single vendor is currently the primary provider of web services that allow the Company to host its Sportsbook, iGaming and DFS product offerings. Any 

F-9 

interruption in the services provided by this supplier could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. 

The Company&#8217;s growth prospects and market potential will depend on its ability to obtain and maintain licenses to operate in a number of jurisdictions, and if the Company fails to obtain and maintain such licenses, its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be impaired. 

We conduct business in numerous countries that carry high levels of currency, political, compliance and economic risk. For example, we have offices in Ukraine and Israel, and the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the evolving conflict in Israel and Gaza and any business interruptions or other spillover effects from such conflicts could adversely affect our operations. 

Business Combinations 

&#160; 

The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting, in accordance with ASC 805, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. Any fair value of purchase consideration in excess of the fair value of the assets acquired less liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are determined based upon the valuation of the acquired business and involve management making significant estimates and assumptions. 

&#160; 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

&#160; 

Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid, unrestricted savings, checking, money market funds with original maturities of less than three months and other bank accounts. 

&#160; 

Restricted Cash 

&#160; 

Restricted cash refers to cash that is held by the company but cannot be used for continuing operations. Restricted cash as of December 31, 2023, primarily relates to collateral for a letter of credit in connection with a cyber-security insurance policy entered into in 2023. 

Cash Reserved for Users 

&#160; 

The Company maintains separate bank accounts to segregate users&#8217; funds from operational funds. In certain regulated jurisdictions, user funds are held by DK Player Reserve LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of DraftKings Inc., which was organized for the purpose of protecting users&#8217; funds in the event of creditor claims and complying with certain regulatory requirements of gaming authorities in certain jurisdictions. 

&#160; 

Receivables Reserved for Users 

&#160; 

Receivables for user deposits not yet received are stated at the amount the Company expects to collect from a payment processor, which includes an allowance for credit losses if appropriate. These receivables arise, primarily, due to process timing between when a user deposits and when the Company receives that deposit from the payment processor. The allowance for credit losses is determined based on the Company&#8217;s assessment of the probability of the non-payment of the receivable. This provision is netted against the receivable balance with the loss being recognized within general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. As of and for the years ending December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the provision did not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. 

Accounts Receivables 

&#160; 

Accounts receivables are recorded at amortized cost, less any allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is determined based on the Company&#8217;s assessment of the probability of non-payment of the receivable after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. This provision is netted against the receivable balance with the loss being recognized within general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. As of and for the years ending December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the provision did not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. 

Digital Assets and Liabilities 

F-10 

On March 31, 2022, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (&#8220;SAB 121&#8221;). SAB 121 sets out interpretive guidance from the staff of the SEC regarding the accounting for obligations to safeguard digital assets that an entity holds for its users, which was effective from the first interim period commencing after June 15, 2022, with retroactive application as of the beginning of the fiscal year to which the interim or annual period relates. In accordance with SAB 121, the Company recognized a liability for the obligation to safeguard its users&#8217; assets and recognized an associated asset for non-fungible tokens (&#8220;NFTs&#8221;) held for its users. Both the liability and the associated asset are measured at the fair value of the NFTs being safeguarded. Refer to Note 8 hereof for disclosures required in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement . &#160; 

Property and Equipment, Net 

&#160; 

Property and equipment are carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed utilizing the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. Leasehold improvements depreciation is computed over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life of the asset. Additions and improvements are capitalized, while repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Useful lives of each asset class are generally as follows: 

&#160; 

##TABLE_START Computer equipment and software 3 years Furniture and fixtures 7 years Leasehold improvements 

Lesser of the lease terms or the estimated useful lives of the improvements, generally 1 &#8211; 10 years 

##TABLE_END

&#160; 

Intangible Assets, Net 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s intangible assets consist of developed technology, customer relationships, internally-developed software, gaming licenses, trademarks and tradenames and digital assets. The related amortization expense is classified as cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. Estimates and assumptions that we must make in estimating the fair value of future acquired technology, user lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. 

&#160; 

Developed Technology 

&#160; 

Developed technology primarily relates to the design and development of sports betting and casino gaming software for online and retail sportsbook and casino gaming products acquired from SBTech and other acquisitions and recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. 

&#160; 

Internally Developed Software 

&#160; 

Software that is developed for internal use is accounted for pursuant to ASC 350-40, Intangibles, Goodwill and Other&#8212;Internal-Use Software . Qualifying costs incurred to develop internal-use software are capitalized when (i) the preliminary project stage is completed, (ii) management has authorized further funding for the completion of the project and (iii) it is probable that the project will be completed and perform as intended. These capitalized costs include compensation for employees who develop internal-use software and external costs related to development of internal use software. Capitalization of these costs ceases once the project is substantially complete and the software is ready for its intended purpose. Internally developed software is amortized using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life. All other expenditures, including those incurred in order to maintain an intangible asset&#8217;s current level of performance, are expensed as incurred. When intangible assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated amortization thereon are removed, and any resulting gain or losses are included in the consolidated statements of operations. 

&#160; 

Gaming Licenses 

&#160; 

The Company incurs fees in connection with applying for and maintaining good standing in jurisdictions via business licenses. Fees incurred in connection with the application and subsequent renewals are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life. In certain arrangements, the Company enters into agreements to operate on a business partner&#8217;s license in exchange for upfront fees. These fees are capitalized and amortized over the shorter of their expected benefit under the partnership agreement or estimated useful life. 

&#160; 

Customer Relationships 

&#160; 

F-11 

Customer (or &#8220;user&#8221;) relationships are finite-lived intangible assets, which are amortized over their estimated economic lives. Customer relationships are generally recognized as the result of business combinations. 

Trademarks and Tradenames 

&#160; 

The Company incurs fees in connection with applying for and maintaining trademarks and tradenames as well as trademarks and tradenames resulting from acquisitions. Fees incurred in connection with the application and subsequent renewals are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life. 

Digital Assets 

The Company has purchased certain digital assets, including crypto currencies, with cash that is not required to currently support its operations. The Company accounts for digital assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles&#8212;Goodwill and Other (Topic 350). Accordingly, if the fair market value at any point during the reporting period is lower than the carrying value an impairment loss equal to the difference will be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations. We have not recorded any significant impairments. 

&#160; 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 

&#160; 

Long-lived assets, except for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, consist of property and equipment and finite-lived acquired intangible assets, such as internal-use software, developed software, gaming licenses, trademarks, tradenames, and customer relationships. Long-lived assets, except for goodwill and indefinite-lived assets, are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable. Impairment expense is recognized to the extent an asset&#8217;s expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the asset&#8217;s carrying amount. The Company determined that there was no impairment of long-lived assets during 2023, 2022, or 2021. 

&#160; 

Goodwill 

&#160; 

The Company regularly reviews its reporting units and the approach used by the CODM and segment management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. Prior to 2023, the Company&#8217;s business was classified into three reporting units: B2C, Media and B2B. However, as a result of the Company&#8217;s integration of its B2B business and change in reporting structure to the CODM, the Company determined that it only had one reporting unit as of October 1, 2023, the Company&#8217;s annual goodwill impairment assessment date. In testing goodwill for impairment, the Company has the option to begin with a qualitative assessment, commonly referred to as &#8220;Step 0,&#8221; to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit containing goodwill is less than its carrying value. This qualitative assessment may include, but is not limited to, reviewing factors such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, entity-specific financial performance and other events, such as changes in the Company&#8217;s management, strategy and primary user base. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company performs a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis by comparing the carrying amount to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, goodwill will be written down to the fair value and recorded as impairment expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company performs its impairment testing annually and when circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. The Company performed its annual impairment assessment of goodwill as of October 1, 2023 and, with consideration regarding the change in reporting units, concluded that goodwill was not impaired. 

Equity Method Investments 

&#160; 

The Company has a 49.9 % membership interest in DKFS, LLC, also known as DRIVE by DraftKings as of December 31, 2023. In addition, the Company has committed to invest up to $ 17.5 million into DBDK Venture Fund I, LP, a Delaware limited partnership and a subsidiary of DKFS LLC. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had invested a total of $ 7.6 million of the total commitment, which represents ownership of approximately 28.6 % in t he fund. 

The Company uses the equity method to account for investments in which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee, but it does not exercise control and is not the primary beneficiary. The Company&#8217;s judgment regarding its level of influence over the equity method investee includes considering key factors, such as ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, and participation in policy-making decisions. The Company&#8217;s carrying value in the equity method investee is reflected in the caption &#8220;Equity method investments&#8221; 

F-12 

on the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in value of DKFS, LLC and DBDK Venture Fund I, LP are recorded in &#8220;Loss (income) from equity method investment&#8221; on the consolidated statements of operations. 

&#160; 

Under the equity method, the Company&#8217;s investment is initially measured at cost and subsequently increased or decreased to recognize the Company&#8217;s share of income and losses of the investee, capital contributions and distributions and impairment losses. The Company performs a qualitative assessment annually and recognizes an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. There was no such impairment recorded during 2023, 2022, or 2021. 

&#160; 

Leases 

The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception and categorizes it as either operating or finance based on the criteria of ASC 842. An arrangement contains a lease when the arrangement conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset over the lease term. Operating leases are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company currently does not have any finance leases. The Company elects certain practical expedients that include not separating lease and non-lease components and it does not apply the right-of-use (&#8220;ROU&#8221;) assets and lease liability recognition requirements to short-term leases. 

Lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. These leases typically do not provide an implicit rate; therefore, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term in an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. ROUs are recognized at the lease commencement date at the value of the lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made prior to commencement and exclude lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred. The lease terms include all non-cancelable periods and may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term. 

Liabilities to Users 

The Company records liabilities for user account balances and pending wagers. User account balances consist of user deposits, most promotional awards and user winnings less user withdrawals, tax withholdings and user losses. Liabilities for user account balances may be covered through a combination of cash reserved for users, receivables reserved for users and surety bonds for the benefit of users. 

&#160; 

Loss Contingencies 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s loss contingencies, which are included within accounts payable and accrued expenses or other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, are uncertain by nature and their estimation requires significant management judgment as to the probability of loss and estimation of the amount of such loss. These contingencies include, but may not be limited to, litigation, indirect taxes, regulatory investigations and proceedings and management&#8217;s evaluation of complex laws and regulations, and the extent to which they may apply to our business and industry. 

&#160; 

The Company regularly reviews its contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss is probable or reasonably possible and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss can be made. Determination of whether a loss estimate can be made is a complex undertaking that considers the judgement of management, third-party research, the prospect of negotiation and interpretations by regulators and courts, among other information. When a loss is determined to be probable, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, an estimated contingent liability is recorded and the related legal costs are expensed as incurred. 

Revenue Recognition 

&#160; 

The Company records revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (&#8220;ASC 606&#8221;). ASC 606 requires companies to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the standard requires more detailed disclosures to enable readers of the financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. See Note 9 ( Revenue Recognition ) for further information. 

&#160; 

F-13 

The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps: 

&#160; 

&#8226; Identify the contract, or contracts, with the customer; 

&#8226; Identify the performance obligations in the contract; 

&#8226; Determine the transaction price; 

&#8226; Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and 

&#8226; Recognize revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies performance obligations by transferring the promised good or services. 

&#160; 

The Company is currently engaged in the business of digital sports entertainment and gaming and provides its users with online gaming opportunities. The Company also provides online sportsbook and casino operators with technical infrastructure as well as related services with respect to its direct customers and distributors. The following is a description of the Company&#8217;s revenue streams: 

&#160; 

Online gaming 

&#160; 

Sportsbook or sports betting involves a user wagering money on an outcome or series of outcomes occurring. When a user&#8217;s wager wins, the Company pays the user a pre-determined amount known as fixed odds. Sportsbook revenue is generated by setting odds such that there is a built-in theoretical margin in each sports wagering opportunity offered to users. Sportsbook revenue is generated from users&#8217; wagers net of payouts made on users&#8217; winning wagers and incentives awarded to users. 

&#160; 

iGaming, or online casino, typically includes digital versions of wagering games available in land-based casinos, such as blackjack, roulette and slot machines. For these product offerings, the Company functions similarly to land-based casinos, generating revenue through hold, as users play against the house. iGaming revenue is generated from user wagers net of payouts made on users&#8217; winning wagers and incentives awarded to users. 

&#160; 

DFS is a peer-to-peer product offering in which contestants compete against one another for prizes. Contestants pay an entry fee to join a DFS contest and compete for prizes, which are distributed to the highest performing contestants in each contest as defined by each contest&#8217;s prize table. DFS revenue is generated from contest entry fees from contestants, net of prizes and customer incentives awarded to contestants. 

Sportsbook, iGaming, and DFS, each as described above, create a single performance obligation for the Company to operate contests or games and award prizes or payouts to users based on results. Revenue is recognized at the conclusion of each wager, wagering game hand or contest. Incentives can be used across online gaming product offerings. Additionally, certain incentives given to customers create material rights and represent separate performance obligations. User incentives in certain cases create liabilities when awarded to players and in those cases are generally recognized as revenue upon redemption. 

&#160; 

Gaming software 

&#160; 

The Company contracts with business customers to provide sports and casino betting software solutions. Gaming software revenue is recognized when control of the solutions is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for providing control of the sports betting and casino software. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s direct customer contract revenue is generally calculated as a percentage of the wagering revenue generated by the business customer using our software and is recognized in the periods in which those wagering and related activities conclude. Our direct customer arrangements do not provide the customers with the right to take possession of our software, but only the right to purchase access to the Company&#8217;s sports and casino wagering software for a defined contractual period. 

Media and advertising revenue 

&#160; 

The Company enters contracts with businesses where it receives consideration in exchange for advertisement activities over the related campaign periods. These services are grouped into advertising promises and sponsored game promises. The advertising packages range from standard ad placements and background ad placements to more high-touch integrations, such as sponsored DFS contest series or custom site takeovers. Media and advertising revenue is generated from business users and recognized ratably over the respective ad periods. 

F-14 

Non-fungible token (&#8220;NFT&#8221;) content 

The Company launched DraftKings Marketplace during the third quarter of 2021. Marketplace is a digital collectibles (non-fungible token or &#8220;NFT&#8221;) ecosystem designed for mainstream accessibility that offers curated initial NFT drops (&#8220;Primary Sales&#8221;). In addition to Primary Sales, owners of NFTs on Marketplace can list their NFTs for sale to other Marketplace customers (&#8220;Secondary Sales&#8221;). The revenue that the Company earns from Marketplace is primarily based on a specific percentage of the gross value of each Primary Sale or Secondary Sale. The revenue is recognized for each sale when the NFT transfers to the end user. 

&#160; 

Transaction Price Considerations 

&#160; 

Variability in the transaction price arises primarily due to market-based pricing, cash discounts, revenue sharing and usage-based fees. DraftKings offers loyalty programs, free plays, deposit bonuses, discounts, rebates and other rewards and incentives to its customers. Revenue for Sportsbook, iGaming and DFS is collected prior to the contest or event and is fixed once the outcome is known. Prizes paid and payouts made to users are recognized when awarded to the player. 

&#160; 

Contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, the transaction price is allocated to performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. Standalone selling prices are estimated based on observable data of the Company&#8217;s sales of such products and services to similar customers and in similar circumstances on a standalone basis. For Online Gaming, which includes Sportsbook, iGaming and DFS, the Company allocates a portion of the transaction price to certain customer incentives that create material future customer rights. In addition, in the event of a multi-stage contest, the Company will allocate transaction price ratably from contest start to the contest&#8217;s final stage. 

&#160; 

Certain costs to obtain or fulfill contracts 

&#160; 

Under ASC 606, certain costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer must be capitalized, to the extent recoverable from the associated contract margin, and subsequently amortized as the products or services are delivered to the customer. These costs are capitalized as contract acquisition costs and are amortized over the period of benefit to the customer. For the Company, the period of benefit is typically less than or equal to one year . As such, the Company applied the practical expedient and contract acquisition costs are expensed immediately. Customer contract costs which do not qualify for capitalization as contract fulfillment costs are expensed as incurred. 

&#160; 

Contract balances 

&#160; 

Contract assets and liabilities represent the differences in the timing of revenue recognition from the receipt of cash from the Company&#8217;s customers and billings to those customers. Contract assets reflect revenue recognized and performance obligations satisfied in advance of customer billing. 

&#160; 

Deferred revenue primarily represents contract liabilities related to the Company&#8217;s obligation to transfer future value in relation to in-period transactions in which the Company has received consideration. Such obligations are recognized as liabilities when awarded to users and are recognized as revenue when those liabilities are later resolved. The Company maintains various programs to incentivize user behavior, which allow users to earn awards. Incentive awards generally represent a material right to the user, and awards may be redeemed for future services. Incentive awards earned by users, but not yet redeemed, are generally recognized as a reduction to revenue and included within liabilities to users on our consolidated balance sheets. When a user redeems most types of awards, the Company recognizes revenue on its consolidated statements of operations. Certain player awards are not subject to expiration or have not been expired historically; on such awards the Company recognizes breakage (for amounts not expected to be redeemed) to the extent there is no requirement for remitting such balances to regulatory agencies. In addition to these incentive programs, the Company&#8217;s deferred revenue balance also consists of wagered amounts that relate to unsettled or pending outcomes. 

Cost of Revenue 

&#160; 

Cost of revenue consists primarily of variable costs. These include mainly (i) product taxes, (ii) payment processing fees and chargebacks, (iii) platform costs directly associated with revenue-generating activities, including those costs that were originally capitalized for internally developed software, (iv) revenue share / market access arrangements, and (v) feed / provider services. The Company incurs payment processing fees on user deposits, withdrawals and deposit reversals from payment processors. Cost of revenue also includes expenses related to the distribution of our services, amortization of intangible assets and compensation of revenue associated personnel. 

F-15 

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of expenses associated with advertising, conferences, costs related to free to play contests, rent and facilities maintenance, and the compensation of sales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation expenses. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included in sales and marketing expense in our consolidated statements of operations. Advertising costs include those costs associated with communicating with potential customers and generally use some form of media, such as internet, radio, print, television, or billboards. Advertising costs also include costs associated with strategic league and team partnerships. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, advertising costs calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP were $ 984.4 million , $ 964.9 million and $ 831.1 million, respectively. 

&#160; 

Product and Technology 

&#160; 

Product and technology expenses consist primarily of research and development costs that are not capitalized and other costs not associated directly with revenue generating activities. Research and development costs primarily represent employee expenses (including stock-based compensation) for engineering product, design, analytical research and project management incurred for non-revenue generating activities. Other costs include related overhead for rent, facilities maintenance, third party software licenses and consulting services. 

&#160; 

General and Administrative 

&#160; 

General and administrative expenses consist of costs not related to sales and marketing, product and technology or revenue. General and administrative costs include professional services (including legal, regulatory, audit, accounting, lobbying and services related to acquisitions), rent and facilities maintenance, contingencies, insurance, allowance for credit losses, depreciation of leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures and costs related to the compensation of executive and non-executive personnel, including stock-based compensation. 

Benefit Plans 

The Company maintains a defined contribution plan, which covers a majority of employees. The plan allows for employee salary deferrals, which are matched at our discretion. The Company contributions to these plans were $ 11.6 million, $ 9.3 million and $ 6.7 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

&#160; 

Stock-based Compensation 

&#160; 

The Company measures compensation cost for stock options and other stock awards in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation&#8212;Stock Compensation . Stock-based compensation is measured at fair value on grant date and recognized as compensation cost over the requisite service period. Generally, the Company issues stock options and other stock awards to employees with service-based or performance-based vesting conditions. For awards with only service-based vesting conditions, the Company records compensation cost for these awards using the straight-line method less an assumed forfeiture rate. For awards with performance-based vesting conditions, the Company recognizes compensation cost on a tranche-by-tranche basis (the accelerated attribution method), based on the probability of achieving the performance criteria. 

&#160; 

Under the provisions of ASC 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees , the Company measures stock-based awards granted to non-employees at the earlier of: (i) the performance commitment date, or (ii) the date the services required under the arrangement have been completed. Compensation cost is recognized over the period during which services are rendered by non-employees until service is completed.

Income Taxes 

&#160; 

The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements or in the Company&#8217;s tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the differences between U.S. GAAP treatment and tax treatment of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax liabilities are included in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are included in the income tax (benefit) provision in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent it believes, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established through a charge to income tax expense. Potential for recovery of deferred tax assets is evaluated by considering taxable income of the appropriate source and character in carryback years, existing taxable temporary differences, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable profits. 

The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in its consolidated financial statements by applying a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination by the taxing authorities. If the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not to be sustained, the tax position is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in our consolidated financial statements. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions are included in long-term income tax liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The income tax (benefit) provision includes the effects of any resulting tax reserves, or unrecognized tax benefits, that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties. 

Loss per share 

&#160; 

Basic loss per share is calculated using the two-class method. Under the two-class method, basic loss is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period excluding the effects of any potentially dilutive instruments. The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period includes Class A common stock but is exclusive of Class B common stock as these shares have no economic or participating rights. Diluted loss per share is computed similar to basic loss per share, except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potential common shares had been issued if such additional common shares were dilutive. Since the Company had net losses for all the periods presented, basic and diluted loss per share are the same, and additional potential common shares have been excluded, as their effect would be anti-dilutive. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 

In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions (&#8220;ASU 2022-03&#8221;), which clarifies the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement (&#8220;Topic 820&#8221;), when measuring the fair value of an equity security subject to contractual restrictions that prohibit the sale of an equity security and introduces new disclosure requirements for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions that are measured at fair value in accordance with Topic 820. ASU 2022-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and early adoption is permitted. While the Company is continuing to assess the potential impacts of ASU 2022-03, it does not expect ASU 2022-03 to have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , to improve reportable segment disclosures. The guidance expands the disclosures required for reportable segments in our annual and interim consolidated financial statements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The standard will be effective for us beginning with our annual reporting for fiscal year 2024 and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our segment disclosures. 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-08, Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets (Topic 820) , a new standard designed to enhance decision-useful information about such assets and to better reflect the underlying economics of cryptocurrency transactions. The standard will be effective for us beginning with our annual reporting for fiscal year 2025 and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our digital assets&#8217; accounting and disclosures.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes&#8212;Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (&#8220;ASU 2023-09&#8221;). ASU 2023-09 modifies the rules on income tax disclosures to enhance the transparency and decision-usefulness of income tax disclosures, particularly in the rate reconciliation table and disclosures about income taxes paid. The amendments are intended to address investors&#8217; requests for income tax disclosures that provide more information to help them better understand an entity&#8217;s exposure to potential changes in tax laws and the ensuing risks and opportunities and to assess income tax information that affects cash flow forecasts and capital allocation decisions. The guidance also eliminates certain existing disclosure requirements related to uncertain tax positions and unrecognized deferred tax liabilities. ASU 2023-09 is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. All entities are required to apply the guidance prospectively but have the option to apply it retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is continuing to assess the timing of adoption and the potential impacts of ASC 2023-09. 

3. Business Combinations 

&#160; 

Acquisition of Golden Nugget Online Gaming, Inc. 

On May 5, 2022, DraftKings consummated the GNOG Transaction, and, under the terms of the GNOG Merger Agreement and subject to certain exclusions contained therein, GNOG stockholders received a fixed ratio of 0.365 shares of DraftKings Inc.&#8217;s Class A common stock for each share of GNOG that they held on the GNOG Closing Date. DraftKings Inc. issued approximately 29.3 million shares of its Class A common stock in connection with the consummation of the GNOG Transaction. 

Operating results for GNOG on and after the GNOG Closing Date are included in the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. Because the Company is integrating GNOG&#8217;s operations into its consolidated operating activities, the amount of revenue and earnings attributable to the GNOG business for 2022, which is included within revenue and net loss attributable to common stockholders in the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of operations , was impracticable to determine. 

Purchase Price Accounting for the GNOG Transaction 

On the GNOG Closing Date, the Company acquired 100 % of the equity interests of GNOG pursuant to the GNOG Merger Agreement. The following is a summary of the consideration issued on the GNOG Closing Date: 

##TABLE_START 

Share consideration (1) 

$ 460,128 &#160; 

Other consideration (2) 

143,337 &#160; Total consideration $ 603,465 &#160; ##TABLE_END

(1) Includes the issuance of approximately 29.3 million shares of DraftKings Inc.&#8217;s Class A common stock issued at a price of $ 15.73 . 

(2) Includes (i) $ 170.9 million of payments made by the Company on behalf of GNOG, including repayment of the outstanding portion of GNOG&#8217;s term loan (including the associated prepayment premium) and payment of certain of GNOG&#8217;s transaction expenses incurred in connection with the GNOG Transaction and (ii) warrants that were exercisable for shares of GNOG Class A common stock prior to the GNOG Closing Date, which were assumed by DraftKings in connection with the GNOG Transaction and became eligible to be converted into approximately 2.1 million shares of DraftKings Inc.&#8217;s Class A common stock in the aggregate. These payments were partially offset by commercial credits received by the Company from Fertitta Entertainment, Inc. (&#8220;FEI&#8221;), which can be applied by the Company from time to time to offset future amounts otherwise owed by it to FEI or its affiliates under commercial arrangements among such parties, subject to certain limited exceptions. 

F-18 

The following table summarizes the consideration issued or paid in connection with the GNOG Transaction and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the consummation of the GNOG Transaction on the GNOG Closing Date: 

##TABLE_START Cash and cash equivalents $ 66,709 &#160; Cash reserved for users 7,633 &#160; Receivables reserved for users 2,814 &#160; Accounts receivables 7,783 &#160; Prepaid expenses and other current assets 64 &#160; Property and equipment, net 1,433 &#160; Intangible assets, net 315,000 &#160; Operating lease right-of-use assets 1,185 &#160; Deposits and other non-current assets 47,395 &#160; Total identifiable assets acquired 450,016 &#160; Liabilities assumed: Accounts payable and accrued expenses 32,989 &#160; Liabilities to users 4,314 &#160; Operating lease liabilities 1,185 &#160; Other long-term liabilities 78,781 &#160; Total liabilities assumed 117,269 &#160; Net assets acquired (a) 332,747 &#160; Purchase consideration (b) 603,465 &#160; Goodwill (b) &#8211; (a) $ 270,718 &#160; ##TABLE_END

Goodwill represents the excess of the gross consideration transferred over the difference between the fair value of the underlying net assets acquired and the underlying liabilities assumed. Qualitative factors that contribute to the recognition of goodwill include certain intangible assets that are not recognized as separate identifiable intangible assets apart from goodwill. Intangible assets not recognized apart from goodwill consist primarily of benefits from securing buyer-specific synergies that increase revenue and profits and are not otherwise available to a market participant, as well as acquiring a talented workforce and cost savings opportunities. Goodwill recognized is partially deductible for tax purposes, and the amount of deductible goodwill was determined to be $ 160.7 million.

Loan Receivable 

The Company acquired a long-term receivable in the amount of $ 30.1 million in connection with the GNOG Transaction, which originally resulted from a $ 30.0 million mezzanine loan (the &#8220;Danville GN Casino Loan&#8221;) by GNOG to certain parties before the GNOG Closing Date to develop and construct a &#8220;Golden Nugget&#8221;-branded casino in Danville, Illinois, pending regulatory approvals, that would enable GNOG to obtain market access to the State of Illinois. There has been no significant deterioration of credit quality since the origination date of the Danville GN Casino Loan. The receivable related to the Danville GN Casino Loan is classified within deposits and other non-current assets on the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet. 

F-19 

Transaction Costs 

For the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred $ 14.9 million and $ 9.2 million, respectively, in advisory, legal, accounting and management fees in connection with the GNOG Transaction, which are included in general and administrative expenses on the Company&#8217;s consolidated statements of operations. 

Unaudited Pro-Forma Information

Vegas Sports Information Network, Inc. Acquisition 

On March 26, 2021, the Company acquired 100 % of the equity of Vegas Sports Information Network, Inc. (&#8220;VSiN&#8221; and such acquisition, the &#8220;VSiN Acquisition&#8221;) for $ 40.6 million of cash and approximately $ 29.4 million of the Company&#8217;s Class A common stock. 

The acquired assets and assumed liabilities of VSiN were recorded at their estimated fair values, including $ 21.8 million of intangible assets. Goodwill of $ 47.2 million represents the excess of the gross considerations transferred over the fair value of the underlying net assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill associated with the VSiN Acquisition is assigned as of the acquisition date to the Company&#8217;s Media reporting unit. The purchase price allocation for the VSiN Acquisition was finalized as of December 31, 2021. Goodwill recognized is no t deductible for tax purposes. As VSiN&#8217;s financial results are not material to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements, the Company has elected to not include pro forma results. 

Blue Ribbon Software Ltd. Acquisition 

On April 1, 2021, the Company acquired 100 % of the equity of Blue Ribbon Software Ltd.

7. Current and Long-term Liabilities 

&#160; 

F-22 

Revolving Line of Credit 

&#160; 

On December 20, 2022, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement with Pacific Western Bank and Citizens Bank, as lenders (as amended, the &#8220;Credit Agreement&#8221;), which provides the Company with a revolving line of credit of up to $ 125.0 million (the &#8220;Revolving Line of Credit&#8221;). The Credit Agreement has a maturity date of December 20, 2024 and replaced the Company&#8217;s amended and restated loan and security agreement entered into with Pacific Western Bank in October 2016 (the &#8220;Prior Credit Agreement&#8221;), which provided a revolving line of credit of up to $ 60.0 million and was terminated in connection with the Company&#8217;s entry into the Credit Agreement. 

Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a variable annual rate equal to the greater of (i) 1.00 % above the prime rate then in effect and (ii) 5.00 %, and the Credit Agreement requires monthly, interest-only payments on any outstanding borrowings. In addition, the Company is required to pay quarterly in arrears a commitment fee equal to 0.25 % per annum of the unused portion of the Revolving Line of Credit. As of December 31, 2023, the Credit Agreement provided a revolving line of credit of up to $ 125.0 million, and there was no principal outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Net borrowing capacity available from the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2023 totaled $ 122.7 million. The Company is also subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants, including the restriction of dividends, under the Credit Agreement which it is in compliance with as of December 31, 2023. One such covenant involves maintaining compensating cash balances. The compensating balances may be withdrawn but the availability of the line of credit is dependent upon maintenance of such compensating balances. The performance of the Company&#8217;s obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by a first-priority security interest on substantially all of its assets. 

Convertible Notes and Capped Call 

&#160; 

In March 2021, Old DraftKings issued zero-coupon convertible senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $ 1,265.0 million, which includes proceeds from the full exercise of the over-allotment option (collectively, the &#8220;Convertible Notes&#8221;). The Convertible Notes will mature on March 15, 2028 (the &#8220;Notes Maturity Date&#8221;), subject to earlier conversion, redemption or repurchase. In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, Old DraftKings incurred $ 17.0 million of lender fees and $ 1.7 million of debt financing costs, which are being amortized through the Notes Maturity Date. The Convertible Notes represent senior unsecured obligations of Old DraftKings, which are being amortized through the Notes Maturity Date. On May 5, 2022, in connection with the consummation of the GNOG Transaction, (i) DraftKings Inc. agreed to fully and unconditionally guarantee all of Old DraftKings&#8217; obligations under the Convertible Notes and the indenture governing the Convertible Notes and (ii) each Convertible Note which was outstanding as of the consummation of the GNOG Transaction and previously convertible into shares of Old DraftKings Class A common stock became convertible into shares of DraftKings Inc. Class A common stock. 

The Convertible Notes are convertible at an initial conversion rate of 10.543 shares of DraftKings Inc.&#8217;s Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $ 94.85 per share of DraftKings Inc.&#8217;s Class A common stock. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events and includes a make-whole adjustment upon early conversion in connection with a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes). For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 there were no changes to the initial conversion price. 

Prior to September 15, 2027, the Convertible Notes will be convertible by the holder only upon satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods, and thereafter, at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the Notes Maturity Date. Old DraftKings will satisfy any conversion election by paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of DraftKings Inc.&#8217;s Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of DraftKings Inc.&#8217;s Class A common stock. During 2022, the conditions allowing holders of the Convertible Notes to convert their Convertible Notes were triggered by the holding company reorganization in connection with the GNOG Transaction, whereby DraftKings Inc. became the going-forward public company and replaced Old DraftKings as the issuer of the Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes; such conversion window expired on June 27, 2022, and no holders of the Convertible Notes exercised their conversion rights. As of December 31, 2023, no conditions were met to allow for the conversion of the Convertible Notes by any holder. 

In connection with the pricing of the Convertible Notes and the exercise of the over-allotment option to purchase additional notes, Old DraftKings entered into a privately negotiated capped call transaction (&#8220;Capped Call Transactions&#8221;). The Capped Call Transactions have a strike price of $ 94.85 per share, subject to certain adjustments, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the Convertible Notes. The Capped Call Transactions have an initial cap price of $ 135.50 per share, subject to certain adjustments. The Capped Call Transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to DraftKings Inc.&#8217;s Class A common stock upon any conversion of Convertible Notes. As the transaction qualifies for equity classification, the net 

F-23 

cost of $ 124.0 million incurred in connection with the Capped Call Transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. 

As of December 31, 2023, the Company&#8217;s convertible debt balance was $ 1,253.8 million, net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $ 11.2 million. The amortization of debt issuance costs were $ 2.7 million, $ 2.7 million and $ 2.1 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and these costs are included in the interest expense line-item on the Company's consolidated statements of operations. Although recorded at amortized cost on the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheets, the estimated fair value of the Convertible Notes was $ 1,025.6 million and $ 786.5 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which was calculated using the estimated or actual bids and offers of the Convertible Notes in an over-the-counter market on the last business day of the period, which is a Level 1 fair value measurement. 

&#160; 

Indirect Taxes 

&#160; 

Taxation of e-commerce is becoming more prevalent and could negatively affect the Company&#8217;s business as it primarily pertains to DFS and its contestants. The ultimate impact of indirect taxes on the Company&#8217;s business is uncertain, as is the period required to resolve this uncertainty. The Company&#8217;s estimated contingent liability for indirect taxes represents the Company&#8217;s best estimate of tax liability in jurisdictions in which the Company believes taxation is probable. The Company frequently reevaluates its tax positions for appropriateness.

Indirect tax statutes and regulations are complex and subject to differences in application and interpretation. Tax authorities may impose indirect taxes on Internet-delivered activities based on statutes and regulations which, in some cases, were established prior to the advent of the Internet and do not apply with certainty to the Company&#8217;s business. The Company&#8217;s estimated contingent liability for indirect taxes may be materially impacted by future audit results, litigation and settlements, should they occur. The Company&#8217;s activities by jurisdiction may vary from period to period, which could result in differences in the applicability of indirect taxes from period to period. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the Company&#8217;s estimated contingent liability for indirect taxes was $ 71.2 million and $ 60.3 million, respectively. The estimated contingent liability for indirect taxes is recorded within other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of operations.

Warrant Liabilities 

&#160; 

As part of the initial public offering of Diamond Eagle Acquisition Corp. (&#8220;DEAC&#8221;) on May 14, 2019 (the &#8220;IPO&#8221;), DEAC issued 13.3 million warrants, each of which entitles the holder to purchase one share of DraftKings Inc.&#8217;s Class A common stock at an exercise price of $ 11.50 per share (the &#8220;Public Warrants&#8221;). Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, DEAC completed the private sale of 6.3 million warrants to DEAC&#8217;s sponsor (the &#8220;Private Warrants&#8221;) where each whole warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of DraftKings Inc.&#8217;s Class A common stock at an exercise price of $ 11.50 per share. As of December 31, 2023, there were no Public Warrants outstanding and 1.4 million Private Warrants outstanding. As of December 31, 2022, there were no Public Warrants outstanding and 1.6 million Private Warrants outstanding. On May 5, 2022, in connection with the consummation of the GNOG Transaction, Old DraftKings entered into an assignment and assumption agreement (the &#8220;Old DraftKings Warrant Assignment Agreement&#8221;) with DraftKings Inc., Computershare Trust Company, N.A. and Computershare Inc. (together, &#8220;Computershare&#8221;), pursuant to which Old DraftKings assigned to DraftKings Inc. all of its rights, interests and obligations under the warrant agreement, dated as of May 10, 2019 (the &#8220;Old DraftKings Warrant Agreement&#8221;), by and between DEAC and Continental Stock Transfer &#38; Trust Company, as warrant agent, as assumed by Old DraftKings and assigned to Computershare by that certain assignment and assumption agreement, dated as of April 23, 2020, governing Old DraftKings&#8217; outstanding Private Warrants, on the terms and conditions set forth in the Old DraftKings Warrant Assignment Agreement. In connection with the consummation of the GNOG Transaction and pursuant to the Old DraftKings Warrant Assignment Agreement, each of the outstanding Private Warrants became exercisable for one share of DraftKings Inc. Class A common stock on the existing terms and conditions, except as otherwise described in the Old DraftKings Warrant Assignment Agreement. 

In addition, on May 5, 2022, in connection with the consummation of the GNOG Transaction, the Company assumed an additional 5.9 million warrants, each of which entitled the holder to purchase one share of GNOG&#8217;s Class A common stock at an exercise price of $ 11.50 per share (the &#8220;GNOG Private Warrants&#8221;). Effective as of the consummation of the GNOG Transaction, each of the outstanding GNOG Private Warrants became exercisable, at a price of $ 31.50 , for 0.365 of a share of DraftKings Inc.&#8217;s Class A common stock, or approximately 2.1 million shares of DraftKings Inc.&#8217;s Class A common stock in the aggregate, on the existing terms and conditions of such GNOG Private Warrants, except as otherwise described in the assignment and assumption agreement relating to the GNOG Private Warrants entered into on the GNOG Closing Date. 

F-24 

The Company classified its Public Warrants, Private Warrants and GNOG Private Warrants pursuant to ASC 815 as derivative liabilities with subsequent changes in their respective fair values recognized in its consolidated statement of operations at each reporting date. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were 5.9 million GNOG Private Warrants outstanding. 

As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of the Company&#8217;s warrant liability was $ 63.6 million. Due to fair value changes throughout 2023, the Company recorded a loss on remeasurement of warrant liabilities of $ 57.5 million and throughout 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded a gain on remeasurement of warrant liabilities of $ 29.4 million and $ 30.1 million, respectively. In 2023, 0.2 million Private Warrants were exercised resulting in a reclassification to additional paid-in-capital in the amount of $ 4.6 million, and no GNOG Private Warrants were exercised. In 2022, a de minimis number of Private Warrants and no GNOG Private Warrants were exercised. In 2021, 0.3 million Private Warrants were exercised, resulting in a reclassification to additional paid-in-capital in the amount of $ 9.2 million. See Note 8 ( Fair Value Measurements ) and Note 13 ( Loss Per Share ) for further information on the Company&#8217;s warrant liabilities. 

&#160; 

8. Fair Value Measurements 

&#160; 

Certain assets and liabilities are carried at fair value under U.S. GAAP. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value and nonrecurring fair value measurements are to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three levels of the fair value hierarchy, of which the first two are considered observable and the last is considered unobservable: 

&#160; 

&#8226; Level 1 &#8212; Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

&#8226; Level 2 &#8212; Observable inputs (other than Level 1 quoted prices), such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar assets or liabilities, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 

&#8226; Level 3 &#8212; Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to determining the fair value of the assets or liabilities, including pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques. 

The following tables set forth the fair value of the Company&#8217;s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 based on the three-tier fair value hierarchy:

F-26 

For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company sold Level 3 derivative instruments with a fair value at December 31, 2022 of $ 6.3 million for proceeds of $ 5.2 million and recorded loss of $ 0.1 million related to this sale. There were no new Level 3 derivative instruments purchased by or issued to the Company for the year ended December 31, 2023. During 2022, the Company did not purchase or issue a significant amount of new derivative instruments. The table below includes a range and an average weighted by relative fair value of the significant unobservable inputs used to measure these Level 3 derivative instruments to fair value. A change in these significant unobservable inputs might result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement at the reporting date. Changes to fair value of these instruments are recorded in Other (loss) income, net on the consolidated statements of operations and Loss (gain) on marketable equity securities and other financial assets, net in the consolidated statement of cash flows.

(6) The Company measures its Private Warrants and the GNOG Private Warrants to fair value using a binomial lattice model or a Black-Scholes model, where appropriate, with the significant assumptions being observable inputs and, accordingly, classifies these liabilities as Level 2. Key assumptions used in the valuation of the Private Warrants and GNOG Private Warrants include term, risk free rate and volatility. See Note 7 Current and Long-term Liabilities and Note 13 Loss Per Share for further information on the Company&#8217;s warrant liabilities. 

During 2022, the Company recorded an unrealized gain of $ 19.9 million in the aggregate for its Level 3 financial assets. The Company did not record any unrealized gains or losses for its Level 3 financial assets during 2023 or 2021. 

9. Revenue Recognition 

&#160; 

Deferred Revenue 

&#160; 

The Company included deferred revenue within accounts payable and accrued expenses and liabilities to users in the consolidated balance sheets. The deferred revenue balances were as follows: 

&#160; 

##TABLE_START &#160; Year Ended December 31, &#160; 2023 2022 2021 Deferred revenue, beginning of the period $ 133,851 &#160; $ 91,554 &#160; $ 30,627 &#160; Deferred revenue, end of the period $ 174,212 &#160; $ 133,851 &#160; $ 91,554 &#160; Revenue recognized in the period from amounts included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the period $ 129,246 &#160; $ 74,837 &#160; $ 28,319 &#160; ##TABLE_END

Deferred revenue primarily represents contract liabilities related to the Company&#8217;s obligation to transfer future value in relation to in period transactions in which the Company has received consideration. These obligations are primarily related to incentive programs and wagered amounts associated with unsettled or pending outcomes that fluctuate based on volume of activity. Such obligations are recognized as liabilities when awarded to users and are recognized as revenue when those liabilities are later resolved, often within the following year. 

Revenue Disaggregation

&#160; 

Online gaming includes online Sportsbook, iGaming, and DFS, which have certain similar attributes and patterns of recognition. Other revenue primarily includes media, retail sportsbooks and other consumer product offerings. The opening and closing balances of the Company's accounts receivable from contracts with customers were $ 51.1 million and $ 47.5 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2023, $ 45.8 million and $ 51.1 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2022, and $ 44.5 million and $ 45.8 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021.

10. Stockholders&#8217; Equity (Deficit) 

Class A Common Stock 

Holders of Class A common stock are entitled to cast one vote per share of Class A common stock. Holders of Class A common stock are not entitled to cumulate their votes in the election of directors. Holders of Class A common stock will share ratably (based on the number of shares of Class A common stock held) if and when any dividend is declared by the Board out of funds legally available therefor, subject to restrictions, whether statutory or contractual (including with respect to any outstanding indebtedness), on the declaration and payment of dividends and to any restrictions on the payment of dividends imposed by the terms of any outstanding preferred stock or any class or series of stock having a preference over, or the right to participate with, the Class A common stock with respect to the payment of dividends. On the liquidation, dissolution, distribution of assets or winding up of DraftKings, each holder of Class A common stock will be entitled, pro rata on a per share basis, to all assets of DraftKings of whatever kind available for distribution to the holders of common stock, subject to the designations, preferences, limitations, restrictions and relative rights of any other class or series of preferred stock of DraftKings then outstanding. 

Class B Common Stock 

Shares of Class B common stock may be issued only to, and registered in the name of, Mr. Robins and any entities wholly owned by Mr. Robins (including all subsequent successors, assigns and permitted transferees). Holders of Class B common stock are entitled to cast 10 votes per share of Class B common stock. Holders of Class B common stock are not entitled to cumulate their votes in the election of directors. Holders of Class B common stock will not participate in any dividend declared by the Board. On the liquidation, dissolution, distribution of assets or winding up of DraftKings, holders of Class B common stock will not be entitled to receive any distribution of DraftKings assets of whatever kind available until distribution has first been made to all holders of Class A common stock. Notwithstanding this, due to the liquidation rights of holders of Class A common stock described above in which all assets of DraftKings of whatever kind available will be distributed to holders of Class A common stock, no assets of DraftKings will be available for liquidating distributions in respect of Class B common stock. 

Preferred Stock 

The Company&#8217;s amended and restated articles of incorporation provide that its Board has the authority, without action by the stockholders, to designate and issue shares of preferred stock in one or more classes or series, and the number of shares 

F-28 

constituting any such class or series, and to fix the voting powers, designations, preferences, limitations, restrictions and relative rights of each class or series of preferred stock, including, without limitation, dividend rights, dividend rates, conversion rights, exchange rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption, dissolution preferences, and treatment in the case of a merger, business combination transaction, or sale of its assets, which rights may be greater than the rights of the holders of the common stock. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had 300.0 million shares authorized of preferred stock, $ 0.0001 par value, of which none were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022. 

11. Stock-Based Compensation 

&#160; 

In 2012, the Company&#8217;s board of directors adopted the 2012 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Incentive Plan (the &#8220;2012 Plan&#8221;), which provides for the granting of incentive and nonqualified stock options, shares of restricted stock and other equity interests or awards in the Company. The Company only issued time-based vesting awards under the 2012 Plan. 

&#160; 

In 2017, the Company&#8217;s board of directors approved the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (the &#8220;2017 Plan&#8221;). No new awards have been issued under the 2012 Plan following the approval of the 2017 Plan. The 2017 Plan provides for the granting of incentive and nonqualified stock options, shares of restricted stock and other equity interests or awards in the Company. The Company issued time-based and performance-based vesting awards under the 2017 Plan. 

In 2020, the Company&#8217;s board of directors approved the 2020 Incentive Award Plan (the &#8220;2020 Plan&#8221;, together with the 2012 Plan and the 2017 Plan, the &#8220;Plans&#8221;). The 2020 Plan provides for the granting of incentive and nonqualified stock options, restricted stock units (&#8220;RSUs&#8221;) and other equity interests or awards in the Company. As of December 31, 2023, the total number of shares available for issuance under the 2020 Plan was 10.1 million shares. There are 10.4 million shares available for issuance under the 2017 Plan, however, we no longer issue awards under the 2017 Plan. There are no securities remaining available for future issuance under the 2012 Plan as this plan has expired pursuant to the terms. The Company issued time-based and performance-based vesting awards under the 2020 Plan. As of December 31, 2023, a share reserve established that the aggregate number of shares may not exceed 900.0 million shares under the Plans. 

&#160; 

The Company has historically issued three types of stock-based compensation: time-based awards, long term incentive plan (&#8220;LTIP&#8221;) awards and performance-based stock compensation plan (&#8220;PSP&#8221;) awards. Time-based awards are equity awards that tie vesting to length of service with the Company. LTIP awards are performance-based equity awards that are used to establish longer-term performance objectives and incentivize management to meet those objectives. PSP awards are performance-based equity awards which establish performance objectives related to one or two particular fiscal years. As applicable, certain stock-based compensation awards expire seven to ten years after the grant date. 

&#160; 

Time-based awards generally vest over a four-year period in annual and/or quarterly installments and, as applicable, expire no later than ten years from the date of grant. Time-based options are valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the assumptions noted in the table below. Shares issued from the exercise of options are issued from the available Class A shares available under the Plans. The fair value of time-based RSUs is estimated on the grant date using the underlying share price. 

LTIP awards that were granted as RSUs subsequent to 2020 vest based on long-term revenue targets and used the underlying share price on the grant date to estimate their fair value. On and after November 2, 2022, certain DraftKings executives agreed to delay vesting of the third tranche of their restricted stock units granted under a long-term incentive plan and to add a service condition through an extended vesting date. This modification impacts the issuance of approximately 4 million shares of DraftKings Inc.&#8217;s Class A common stock, which vested approximately ten months after the performance condition was met. 

&#160; 

PSP awards granted in 2023 and 2022 vest based on achievement of revenue and Adjusted EBITDA targets and have a range of payouts from 0 % to 200 %. PSP awards granted in 2021 and 2020 vest based on achievement of revenue targets and have a range of payouts from 0 % to 300 %. As these awards are performance-based RSUs, the fair value is estimated on the grant date using the underlying share price. 

&#160; 

The fair value of each option is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the assumptions noted in the table below. The fair value is recognized over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. For awards with only service-based vesting conditions, the Company recognizes compensation cost using the straight-line method. Expected volatility is based on an average volatility for a representative sample of 

F-29 

comparable public companies, including the Company. Stock options are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the common stock at the grant date with a 10 -year contractual term. 

&#160; 

The expected term represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding. The Company uses the simplified method as prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, to calculate the expected term for options granted, whereby, the expected term equals the average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the options. The Company uses the simplified method because it does not have sufficient historical option exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term. The risk-free interest rate is estimated using the rate of return on U.S. treasury notes with a life that approximates the expected life of the option. The fair value of the stock options issued was measured using the following assumptions:

Significant components of the Company&#8217;s deferred tax assets (liabilities) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 are as follows: 

&#160; 

F-32 

##TABLE_START &#160; Year ended December 31, &#160; 2023 2022 Deferred tax assets: &#160; &#160; Net operating loss carryforwards $ 1,042,874 &#160; $ 961,352 &#160; Intangible assets 82,813 &#160; 72,299 &#160; Accrual and other temporary differences 59,656 &#160; 57,281 &#160; Operating lease 24,784 &#160; 18,213 &#160; Stock-based compensation 51,065 &#160; 93,582 &#160; Capitalized research and development costs 128,719 &#160; 61,584 &#160; Fixed assets 2,451 &#160; 411 &#160; Gross deferred tax assets 1,392,362 &#160; 1,264,722 &#160; Valuation allowance ( 1,358,934 ) ( 1,228,117 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 33,428 &#160; $ 36,605 &#160; Deferred tax liabilities: Capitalized software costs $ ( 4,535 ) $ ( 7,529 ) Fixed assets ( 162 ) ( 3,590 ) Operating lease ( 25,528 ) ( 16,102 ) Other ( 7,798 ) ( 7,943 ) Gross deferred tax liabilities ( 38,023 ) ( 35,164 ) Total net deferred tax (liabilities) assets $ ( 4,595 ) $ 1,441 &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160; 

&#160; 

In assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized, the Company considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, including its recent cumulative earnings or loss, experience and expectations of future available taxable income of the appropriate source and character by taxing jurisdiction, tax attribute carryback and carryforward periods available for tax purposes, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. 

The Company records its deferred tax assets of $ 7.8 million and $ 10.7 million for 2023 and 2022, respectively, in deposits and other non-current assets and its deferred tax liabilities of $ 12.4 million and $ 9.3 million for 2023 and 2022, respectively, in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company has provided a valuation allowance for the U.S. deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the U.S. valuation allowance increased by $ 130.8 million primarily due to the current year operating losses. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2023, the Company had U.S. federal and state tax net operating loss (&#8220;NOL&#8221;) carryforwards of $ 3.8 billion and $ 4.1 billion, respectively, which may be available to offset future income tax liabilities. Of the federal net operating loss carryforward, $ 0.7 billion expires at various dates beginning in 2032 through 2037 and $ 3.1 billion does not expire. Of the state NOL carryforward, $ 3.9 billion expires at various dates beginning in 2024 through 2043 and $ 0.2 billion does not expire. 

Utilization of the NOL carryforwards may be subject to limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 based on ownership changes that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. These ownership changes may limit the amount of NOL and tax credit carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. There could be additional ownership changes in the future, which may result in additional limitations on the utilization of the NOL and tax credit carryforwards. The Company has analyzed the impact of these limitations on its attributes and included the impact of these limitations in its U.S. deferred tax assets. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2023, foreign earnings of $ 5.7 million have been retained by the Company&#8217;s foreign subsidiaries for indefinite reinvestment. Upon repatriation of those earnings, in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company could be subject to withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to these outside basis differences is not practicable. 

In addition to filing federal income tax returns, the Company files income tax returns in numerous states and foreign jurisdictions that impose an income tax. The Company is subject to U.S. federal, state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years beginning in 2012. The Company is no longer subject to foreign income tax examinations for tax years prior to 2016.

&#160; 

The following table presents a reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, included in long-term income tax liabilities on the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheets: 

&#160; 

##TABLE_START &#160; Year ended December 31, &#160; 2023 2022 2021 Unrecognized tax benefits at the beginning of the year $ 58,011 &#160; $ 72,407 &#160; $ 70,341 &#160; Additions for tax positions of prior years 1,026 &#160; 1,807 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Reduction for tax positions of prior years ( 269 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Additions for tax positions of current year 449 &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Settlements &#8212; &#160; ( 7,412 ) &#8212; &#160; Foreign currency adjustments ( 1,793 ) ( 8,791 ) 2,066 &#160; Unrecognized tax benefits at the end of the year $ 57,424 &#160; $ 58,011 &#160; $ 72,407 &#160; ##TABLE_END

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company had $ 55.9 million, $ 58.0 million and $ 72.4 million, respectively, of net unrecognized tax benefits, which would affect the Company&#8217;s tax rate if recognized. The Company does not anticipate any material changes to its unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. 

The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 the Company recognized $ 5.0 million, $ 6.4 million and $ 5.0 million in interest and penalties. The Company had $ 16.8 million and $ 11.8 million of interest and penalties accrued at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

Significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company's uncertain tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes. Although the Company believes that it has appropriately reserved for its uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than expectations. The Company will adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, the refinement of an estimate, the closing of a statutory audit period or changes in applicable tax law. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences would impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to the reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as related net interest. 

The Company recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other domestic and international tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, the tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained based on the technical merits. The Company believes that it has appropriate support for the income tax positions taken and to be taken on its tax returns and that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax laws applied to the facts of each matter. 

The Company believes it maintains appropriate reserves to offset any potential income tax liabilities that may arise upon final resolution of matters for open tax years. If such reserve amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary, the resulting reversal of such reserves could result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary. If such amounts prove to be less than an ultimate assessment, a future charge to expense would be recorded in the period in which the assessment is determined.

&#160; 

Transactions with a Former Director and their Immediate Family Members 

&#160; 

During 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company had $ 1.4 million, $ 2.3 million, and $ 4.5 million, respectively, in sales to entities related to an immediate family member of a former director. The Company had an associated accounts receivable balance of $ 0.0 million and $ 0.2 million as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, included in accounts receivable in its consolidated balance sheets. 

Aircraft 

Starting in 2022, from time to time, the Company has chartered, without mark-up, the private plane owned by Jason Robins, the Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer, utilizing aircraft services from Jet Aviation Flight Services, Inc. for the business and personal travel of Mr. Robins and his family. The Company had no direct or indirect interest in such private plane. During 2023 and 2022, the Company incurred no expenses and $ 0.7 million of expense, respectively, for use of the aircraft under these chartering services, which was superseded by the lease referred to below. 

F-35 

On March 30, 2022, the Company entered into a one-year lease of an aircraft from an entity controlled by Mr. Robins, pursuant to which Mr. Robins&#8217; entity leased the aircraft to the Company for $ 0.6 million for a one-year period (the &#8220;Original Aircraft Lease&#8221;). The Company covered all operating, maintenance and other expenses associated with the aircraft. The Original Aircraft Lease expired in accordance with its terms on March 30, 2023, and DraftKings entered into a new one-year lease of such aircraft from an entity controlled by Mr. Robins for $ 0.6 million and otherwise on terms and conditions substantially the same as the Original Aircraft Lease, effective upon the expiration of the Original Aircraft Lease (collectively with the Original Aircraft Lease, the &#8220;Aircraft Leases&#8221;). The audit and compensation committees of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors approved this arrangement, as well as the Aircraft Leases, based on, among other things, the requirements of the overall security program that Mr. Robins and his family fly private and the committees' assessment that such an arrangement is more efficient and flexible and better ensures safety, confidentiality and privacy. During 2023 and 2022, the Company incurred $ 0.6 million and $ 0.4 million of expense, respectively, under the aircraft lease. 

15. Leases, Commitments and Contingencies 

&#160; 

Leases 

&#160; 

The Company leases corporate office facilities, data centers, and motor vehicles under operating lease agreements. Some of the Company&#8217;s leases include one or more options to renew. For a majority of the Company&#8217;s leases, it does not assume renewals in its determination of the lease term as the renewals are not deemed to be reasonably assured. The Company&#8217;s lease agreements generally do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. As of December 31, 2023, the Company&#8217;s lease agreements typically have terms not exceeding ten years . 

&#160; 

Payments under the Company&#8217;s lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments primarily represent costs related to common area maintenance and utilities. The components of lease expense are as follows:

Steiner 

Nelson Steiner filed suit against the Company and FanDuel Inc. in Florida state court on November 9, 2015. The action was subsequently transferred to In Re: Daily Fantasy Sports Litigation (Multi-District Litigation) (the &#8220;MDL&#8221;), and Mr. Steiner&#8217;s action was consolidated into the MDL&#8217;s amended complaint, which, in February 2016, consolidated numerous actions (primarily purported class actions) filed against the Company, FanDuel, and other related parties in courts across the United States. By June 23, 2022, the MDL was resolved, except for Mr. Steiner&#8217;s action, and the court officially closed the MDL docket on July 8, 2022. 

Mr. Steiner brings this action as a concerned citizen of the state of Florida alleging that, among other things, defendants&#8217; daily fantasy sports contests are illegal gambling under the state laws of Florida and seeks disgorgement of &#8220;gambling losses&#8221; purportedly suffered by Florida citizens on behalf of the state. On June 23, 2022, the MDL court remanded Mr. Steiner&#8217;s action to the Circuit Court for Pinellas County, Florida. Plaintiff has not yet filed an amended pleading.

Turley 

On January 9, 2023, Simpson G. Turley, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, filed a purported class action against the Company in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Plaintiff alleges, among other things, that he was a contestant in the Company&#8217;s daily fantasy showdown contest for the January 2, 2023, NFL game between the Cincinnati Bengals and the Buffalo Bills (the &#8220;Bengals-Bills Game&#8221;). The Bengals-Bills Game was postponed and 

F-40 

eventually cancelled due to Damar Hamlin collapsing during the game. Plaintiff alleges that he was winning prizes in multiple showdown contests at the point in time that the Bengals-Bills Game was cancelled (with 5:58 remaining in the first quarter). Plaintiff alleges that, instead of paying out the prize money, the Company refunded entry fees to contestants that entered showdown or flash draft fantasy contests. On May 8, 2023, plaintiff Turley and a new plaintiff (Erik Ramos) filed a First Amended Class Action Complaint. The plaintiffs assert claims for breach of contract, unfair and deceptive acts and practices, false advertising, and unjust enrichment. Among other things, plaintiffs seek statutory damages, monetary damages, punitive damages, attorney fees and interest. 

The Company intends to vigorously defend this case. Any adverse outcome in this matter could subject the Company to substantial damages and/or require alterations to the Company&#8217;s business. The Company cannot provide any assurance as to the outcome of this matter.

Securities Matters Related to DraftKings Marketplace 

On March 9, 2023, a putative class action was filed in Massachusetts federal court by alleged purchasers of non-fungible tokens (&#8220;NFTs&#8221;) on the DraftKings Marketplace (&#8220;DK Marketplace&#8221;). The complaint asserts claims for violations of federal and state securities laws against the Company and three of its officers on the grounds that, among other things, the NFTs that are sold and traded on the DK Marketplace allegedly constitute securities that were not registered with the SEC in accordance with federal and Massachusetts law, and that the DK Marketplace is a securities exchange that is not registered in accordance with federal and Massachusetts law. Based on these allegations, plaintiff brings claims seeking rescissory damages and other relief on behalf of himself and a putative class of persons who purchased NFTs on the DK Marketplace between August 11, 2021 and the present. The Company intends to vigorously defend this matter. 

On July 17, 2023, the Company received a subpoena from the Securities Division of the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts seeking documents and requesting answers to interrogatories concerning, among other things, DK Marketplace and NFTs that are sold on DK Marketplace, and related matters.

Shareholder Derivative Litigation Related to DraftKings Marketplace 

On May 31, 2023, a putative shareholder derivative action was filed in Nevada state court by an alleged shareholder of the Company. The action asserts claims on behalf of the Company against certain senior officers and members of the Board of Directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment based primarily on allegations that the defendants caused or allowed the Company to disseminate misleading and inaccurate information to its shareholders in connection with NFTs that are sold and traded on the DK Marketplace. The action also alleges that certain individuals are liable for trading in Company stock at artificially inflated prices. The action seeks unspecified compensatory damages, changes to corporate governance and internal procedures, restitution, disgorgement, costs and attorney&#8217;s fees, and other unspecified relief. 

The Company cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of this matter or determine the extent of any potential liabilities. The Company also cannot provide an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss. Because this action 

F-41

Scanlon

The Plaintiffs are seeking, among other things, injunctive relief, actual damages, double or treble damages, and attorneys&#8217; fees. 

The Company intends to vigorously defend this case. Any adverse outcome in this matter could subject the Company to substantial damages and/or require alterations to the Company&#8217;s business. The Company cannot provide any assurance as to the outcome of this matter. 

The Company cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of the suit or determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.

Internal Revenue Service 

The Company is currently under Internal Revenue Service audit for prior tax years, with the primary unresolved issues relating to excise taxation of fantasy sports contests and informational reporting and withholding.
